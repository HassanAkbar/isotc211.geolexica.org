With the latest update of Geolexica, we are happy to announce that
origin information is now provided for every translated term.

The MLGT contains multiple registers (each in accordance with ISO 19135),
counting one per language.

As all terminological entries in Geolexica are imported from the MLGT,
we are now also able to import the metadata of individual registers within
the MLGT.

All Geolexica included registers are given on the link:/registers/[Registers] page

On an individual concept page, under each term, you will now see a
row labeled "ORIGIN" with the origin information. The displayed
"ORIGIN" contains the name of the register the term was sourced from,
and provides a link to see more information of that register.

Specific contact information of the organization who manages the
register is not provided as we encourage you to use our
link:/feedback/[Feedback] link to provide your comments.

We look forward hearing from you on how Geolexica can better serve your purposes!
