== Introduction

Geolexica is the site name of the online version of the ISO/TC 211 Multi Lingual Glossary of Terms.

This repository provides all necessary information for the
https://www.geolexica.org site. (not yet complete)

The site is managed by the ISO/TC 211 TMG together with Ribose.

NOTE: This repository is only meant for internal consumption!


== How to add/remove entries or suggest changes?

For change suggestions, contact ISO/TC 211 TMG.

This terminology database is managed by the ISO/TC 211 TMG, and it only considers
requests from within ISO/TC 211. The database is not directly community-managed or community-sourced.


=== Change workflow overview

. If a change is approved, TMG publishes the change in a new version of ISO/TC 211 "`Multi-Lingual Glossary of Terms`".

. TMG uploads the new MLGT version to mlgt-data repository.

. After MLGT is uploaded, a database snapshot is created in geolexica-database repository.

. After new snapshot of the database is committed to geolexica-database,
  ISO/TC 211â€™s Geolexica.org is deployed with the latest database version.


== Structure (and how it works)

=== General

There are two types of entries in this site:

. Concepts

. Terms, which represent concepts in a certain language

NOTE: Data stored in this structure is read from the latest published
ISO/TC 211 "`Multi-Lingual Glossary of Terms`". Authoritative data is not
stored in this repository.


=== Multi-Lingual Glossary of Terms

The authoritative source of this online termbase is the Multi-Lingual Glossary of Terms (MLGT) published by ISO/TC 211.

The intermediate file `tc211-termbase.xlsx` is used as the
direct data source for all concepts and terms in Geolexica.

The source data files are provided in a separate private repository:
https://github.com/ISO-TC211/mlgt-data[mlgt-data].

The particular MLGT file used for generation is set in the `Makefile`.

This file is necessary for running the `tc211-termbase-xlsx2yaml` command.


=== Concepts

Every concept is recognized by a unique ID (the "`term id`"), and contains terms
in different languages.

Here's an example of it from the `_concepts/` directory (which has to be built).

[source,yaml]

  id: 2

  definition: designation formed by omitting words or letters from a longer form and
    designating the same concept

=== Term

A term contains multiple attributes, such as:

[source,yaml]
----
id: 2
term: abbreviation
alt: preferred
definition: designation formed by omitting words or letters from a longer form and
  designating the same concept
language_code: eng
notes: []
examples: []
entry_status: valid
authoritative_source: ISO 1087-1:2000, 3.4.9

=== Rendering of HTML

Jekyll is used to render YAML into HTML.

NOTE: Since Jekyll Collections have this flaw where YAML files can't be directly
rendered, a hack is implemented in the Makefile `_concepts` target,
so that every YAML file is converted into AsciiDoc by padding `---` at the end.


== Internal operations

NOTE: These steps are only intended for the internal operator of the site!


=== Building the site

. Ensure geolexica-database submodule is up-to-date.

. Run ``make _site``


=== Deployment

Please push all changes to the `staging` branch, and changes will be automatically deployed and reflected on the staging site.

If your changes are to be made public to the production site, please contact Ribose.
