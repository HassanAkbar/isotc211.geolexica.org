The online version of ISO/TC 211 MLGT has been updated to contain the latest officially translated terms from the
20190809 Edition of the ISO/TC 211 Multi-Lingual Glossary of Terms (MLGT).

The MLGT (20190809 Edition) contains the following terminology records:

* Arabic     684
* Chinese    479
* Danish     206
* Dutch       76
* English   1064

The Malay terms are a new addition to the online version of ISO/TC 211 MLGT. While they were added to the MLGT
in 2018-11, they have not been offered through the online version of ISO/TC 211 MLGT.
